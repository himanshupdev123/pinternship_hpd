- **Focus**: MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js/TypeScript)
- **Approach**: Self-paced learning with structured milestones and live sessions
- **Requirements**: Desktop/laptop (mobile not supported)
- **Internship ID**: Will be mentioned in your NPTEL offer letter
- **Live Sessions**: Scheduled workshops and mentorship meetings (timings conveyed in advance)
- **Attendance**: Compulsory for standups every Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 8:45 PM

| 25% ViBe completion | 1 week | 2.5% |
| 50% ViBe completion | 2 weeks | 5% |
| 75% ViBe completion | 3 weeks | 7.5% |
| 100% ViBe completion | 4 weeks | 10% |
| Case Studies (6 submissions) | 4 weeks | 5% |
| Case Studies (12 submissions) | 5 weeks | 5% |
| Case Studies (18 submissions) | 6 weeks | 7.5% |
| Case Studies (All submissions) | 7 weeks | 10% |
| Projects | 8 weeks | 20% (completion) + 10% (implementation) + 5% (design) |

**Minimum Progress Requirement**: 3.33% daily progress on ViBe platform

## 🎓 The Self-Healing Endorsement Network

After completing case studies, you'll participate in the endorsement system - a peer-driven evaluation framework where interns endorse each other's learning and contributions.

### How It Works:
- **Students endorse each other** based on knowledge and contribution
- **All endorsement chains must connect to a "Jedi"** (Gold/Silver/Bronze ticket holders)
- **Groups not connected to Jedi form "floating islands"** and are inactive
- **Each student can receive only one endorsement** but give multiple
- **Every non-Jedi intern must receive one valid endorsement** to complete internship

### Jedi Role:
- **Jedi holders**: Interns with Silver, Bronze, or Gold tickets
- **Function**: Act as anchors that validate endorsement chains
- **Fixed set**: No new Jedi added (Viva sessions discontinued)

### Endorsement Rules:
- Endorse only after assessing someone's MERN knowledge and case study completion
- Maintain friendly, collaborative interactions (no hierarchy among co-interns)
- **Same college endorsements allowed** but have higher audit probability
- **Tree structure preferred**: Greater length rather than breadth encouraged
- **Deadline**: Must be completed within given timeframe

### Audit Process:
- **Conducted by Bhavna** to identify "Needs Improvement" interns
- **If defaulter found**: Entire endorsement path audited
- **Penalties**: 50% HP penalty for entire connected group
- **Removal**: Defaulter and audit failures removed from network
- **Certification**: Anyone certified as "good" can be endorsed by anyone

### Incentives:
- When someone joins your connected group, everyone gets **5% HP increase**
- Calculated as: 5% of current HP + 5% of new member's HP
- Encourages formation of strong, connected networks

### Data Management:
- **Three-column dataset**: Member 1 (endorser), Member 2 (endorsed), Action
- **Actions**: Add (endorsement), Delete (de-endorsement), Needs Improvement (defaulter status)
- **Submission**: Through official Google Form (link TBD)
- **Form requirements**: Endorser fills once per endorsement with honest remarks

## 🆘 Support & Communication Protocol

Follow this escalation sequence for getting help:

### 1. Self-Help Resources
- Check this handbook
- Review FAQ section
- Search recent Cliq discussions

### 2. Peer Discussion
- Post in **Pinternship - Discussion** Cliq channel
- Reply within threads to keep organized
- Help others to earn health points

### 3. Official Support
- Email: **pinternship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in**
- Response time: Within 2 hours (9 AM - 9 PM)
- Include screenshots/recordings for technical issues

### 4. Escalation Channel

## 🚨 Ejection Policy: Maintaining Momentum

The program uses a dual-path ejection system to maintain high-energy learning environment:

### Forward Eject (The Ascent) 🚀
- **Top performers** get elevated to leadership roles
- May receive **fellowship nominations**
- Based on exceptional performance and sustained momentum

### Backward Eject (The Departure) ⚠️
- **Inactive participants** are removed to maintain cohort quality
- **Triggered only if BOTH conditions met simultaneously**:
  1. Daily ViBe progress below 3.33%
  2. Overall engagement in bottom 10% of cohort
- **Automated and objective** - algorithm-based with manual oversight
- **No appeals allowed** - decisions are final and non-appealable
- **Different from Discontinuation Policy**: Real-time algorithm vs. administrative level

### Why This Policy Exists:
- Protects learning ecosystem quality
- Ensures collaborative activities (peer viva, case studies) are meaningful
- Maintains program resources for committed learners
- Prevents prolonged disengagement from diluting experience

**How to Stay Safe**: Maintain steady progress above minimum threshold and stay actively engaged!
