# 📚 Pinternship Complete Handbook

Welcome to your comprehensive guide for the **Pinternship Full-Stack Development Internship Program**! This handbook consolidates everything you need to know to successfully navigate and complete your internship journey.

---

## 🎯 What is Pinternship?

**Pinternship** is a comprehensive **Full-Stack Development Internship Program** conducted under the expert guidance of **Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar** at **IIT Ropar's VLED Lab**.

This internship is designed for learners who genuinely want to understand how modern web applications are built. Instead of focusing only on theory, the program emphasizes applying concepts in realistic development scenarios and building systems that resemble real production applications.

### Key Features:
- **Duration**: 2 months with possible 15-day extension
- **Mode**: Online only
- **Focus**: MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js/TypeScript)
- **Approach**: Self-paced learning with structured milestones
- **Requirements**: Desktop/laptop (mobile not supported)

## 📋 Milestones & Health Points System

Your progress is tracked through milestones that contribute to your overall Health Points (HP):

| Milestone | Deadline | Health Points |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| 25% ViBe completion | 1 week | 2.5% |
| 50% ViBe completion | 2 weeks | 5% |
| 75% ViBe completion | 3 weeks | 7.5% |
| 100% ViBe completion | 4 weeks | 10% |
| Case Studies (6 submissions) | 4 weeks | 5% |
| Case Studies (12 submissions) | 5 weeks | 5% |
| Case Studies (18 submissions) | 6 weeks | 7.5% |
| Case Studies (All submissions) | 7 weeks | 10% |
| Projects | 8 weeks | 20% (completion) + 10% (implementation) + 5% (design) |

**Minimum Progress Requirement**: 3.33% daily progress on ViBe platform

## 🎓 The Self-Healing Endorsement Network

After completing case studies, you'll participate in the endorsement system:

### How It Works:
- **Students endorse each other** based on knowledge and contribution
- **All endorsement chains must connect to a "Jedi"** (Gold/Silver/Bronze ticket holders)
- **Groups not connected to Jedi form "floating islands"** and are inactive
- **Each student can receive only one endorsement** but give multiple

### Rules:
- Endorse only after assessing someone's MERN knowledge
- Maintain friendly, collaborative interactions
- Endorsements within same college may be audited more frequently
- Poor endorsements can trigger audit penalties for entire connected groups

### Incentives:
- When someone joins your connected group, everyone gets **5% HP increase**
- Calculated as: 5% of current HP + 5% of new member's HP

## 🚨 Ejection Policy: Maintaining Momentum

The program uses a dual-path ejection system:

### Forward Eject (The Ascent) 🚀
- **Top performers** get elevated to leadership roles
- May receive **fellowship nominations**
- Based on exceptional performance and engagement

### Backward Eject (The Departure) ⚠️
- **Inactive participants** are removed to maintain cohort quality
- **Triggered only if BOTH conditions met**:
  1. Daily ViBe progress below 3.33%
  2. Overall engagement in bottom 10% of cohort
- **Automated and objective** - no appeals allowed

**How to Stay Safe**: Maintain steady progress above minimum threshold and stay actively engaged!
