## Introduction

**Pinternship** is an initiative by the Vicharanashala Labs,IIT Ropar under the guidance of Prof.Sudarshan Iyengar, which upskills students on MERN Stack development,deepen them with case studies and finally deploy them on Real world projects. Apart from this an attempt is being made to shift pinterns from endless doom scrolling by an alternative that is equally dopamine driving.

This internship is designed for learners who genuinely want to understand how modern web applications are built. Instead of focusing only on theory, the program emphasizes applying concepts in realistic development scenarios and building systems that resemble real production applications.

### Details and requirements:

**Duration** : 14 Jan 2026 to 24 March 2026 (10 weeks)
**Requirements** : Laptop/Desktop with a stable internet connection.
**Standup sessions**:  standups that  scheduled for every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8:45 PM. Attendance is tracked for all the live session activities. Attendance will be counted only if your camera remains ON for the entire Zoom session. If the camera is not switched on for a sustained duration, the session may not be considered as full attendance.
---

##  Program Phases

The internship is organized into three mandatory components that together form a complete learning journey:

### Phase 1: Core Learning - ViBe Training (Required)
This program follows a carefully structured learning path that covers the complete MERN stack along with the development practices used in modern software teams.

You will begin with the basics of JavaScript, building a strong foundation in core programming concepts. You will then move on to TypeScript, with a focus on writing safe, manageable, and more predictable JavaScript. After that, you will learn React to build interactive, component-driven user interfaces. On the backend, the program introduces MongoDB for designing and managing scalable databases, followed by Express.js for handling APIs and server-side logic.

As you progress, you will also work with concepts such as state management, RESTful API design, middleware usage, database queries and aggregations, performance optimization, and testing. These topics are introduced gradually and reinforced through practical implementation rather than isolated theory.

### Phase 2: Advanced Learning - Case Studies (Required)
Case studies are tightly aligned with the ViBe training modules and are meant to strengthen understanding through application.
Each case study presents a problem to solve, explains the underlying concepts, and walks through practical implementation while highlighting best practices and commonly used patterns.



### Phase 3: Practical Learning - Projects (Required)
Projects form a core part of the learning experience. Instead of standalone assignments, you will contribute to ongoing real-world projects, working on specific features alongside our development team. This hands-on approach allows you to gain practical experience with production-level code, workflows, and collaboration practices. These contributions are designed to be portfolio-worthy and reflect the skills and expectations of a full-stack developer

# No course enrolled
If you see “No course enrolled”:

->Make sure you are logged in with the correct registered email ID.

->Check if your college email has multiple aliases and try the correct one.

->Log out and log in again once.

->If the issue continues, contact support with your registered email ID and a screenshot.

# videos stuck or repeating:
This may happen due to ViBe’s monitored learning system. Common reasons include:

->Videos must be watched fully and in sequence (no skipping).

->Camera and microphone permissions must be enabled.

->Poor lighting or high background noise can affect playback.

->Switching tabs or staying idle may restart the video.

✅ For smooth playback, stay on the ViBe tab, keep your camera on, and watch videos in a quiet, well-lit environment.

**mobile or tablet is not supported and only desktop/laptop is supported**

# troubleshooting video issues like video stuck, looping, skipping:

Try these troubleshooting steps in order:

1. **Refresh the page** and check multiple times
2. **Inspect browser console**: Right-click → Inspect → Go to Network or Console tab → Try watching the video and check for any visible errors
3. **Log out and log in again**
4. **Use a different browser**
5. **Clear browsing data and cache**, then try to re-login

If the issue persists after trying all steps, **record the issue** and email it to: **pinternship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in**.

# ViBe progress not reflecting as 100% even after completing 100% :

Please do not worry. This is a **dashboard-level technical issue** that has already been acknowledged by the support team and communicated in the Cliq threads. The team is actively working on resolving it, and your progress will be **updated automatically** once the issue is fixed.

In the meantime, you may try the following steps once:

1. **Refresh your browser**
2. **Log out**, clear your browser cache, and **log in again**

If the issue still persists after these steps, no further action is required from your side. Your course completion status will be corrected by the support team shortly.


### Phase 2: The Advanced Learning:(Case study phase):

Case studies are the **second required component** (Advanced Learning) of the Pinternship program. They are well-structured, documentation-based lessons designed to help you apply what you learned in ViBe training through **hands-on coding**. Each case study focuses on real-world problem-solving, collaborative thinking, and practical implementation to help you become more confident with the technologies covered.
Case studies are a **required component** for completing the Pinternship program. All participants must complete the case studies after finishing ViBe training and before moving to the Projects phase.

# How to get started with Case Studies:

Go to the Pinternship website,
1. Click the **Case Studies** link in the navigation bar at the top of the page.
2. Select a **technology** and then choose a **lesson**.
3. Read the entire documentation carefully to understand the concept and tasks to be performed.
4. Try to understand each case study first, then attempt to code a solution for it.
5. Open a code editor (for example, **VS Code**) and implement the tasks.
5. Getting stuck is normal. You can ask questions on Cliq, revisit the ViBe videos, and discuss with others.
7. Submit your work using the provided submission link.

# Submitting the Case Studies:

1. Visit the submission form: Will be updated soon.
2. Fill in all required details carefully, including:
   - First name and last name  
   - Email ID associated with the internship  
   - Technology name and lesson number completed  
3. Upload the file containing your solution for the specific lesson  
   (supported formats include `.js`, `.ts`, `.txt`, `.zip`, etc.)
4. Review your details and submit the form.
5. Repeat this process for **each lesson** you complete.

**For lessons (such as React) that involve multiple files, compress all related files into a single ZIP file and upload the ZIP file during submission.**

You can track your submission status, access the leaderboard, and view the dashboard by visiting the Pinternship Live Dashboard section on the website homepage.

If you are facing difficulties in solving the case studies, feel free to,Join the **breakout rooms** during Zoom sessions  
Collaborate and discuss solutions with your peers  
This collaborative approach is encouraged to enhance learning and problem-solving skills.


### Phase 3: The Application:(Projects phase):

Once completed with the ViBe and Case Studies phases, We have some project ideas from the existing open source projects from Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design and Annam.AI listed on the Pinternship website. You can contribute to these real-time open-source projects, working with our developers to build real applications and add new features.

### Parallel Phases: Endorsement phase

The Endorsement phase begins after your Case Studies phase and runs paralelly with the projects phase.

## Ticket holders (Gold, Silver, Bronze):
Participants who consistently perform well and complete all program requirements may receive recommendations from the VLED Lab and eventually become the Gold, Silver and Bronze Ticket Holders.

The **Self-Healing Endorsement Network** is the official evaluation framework for the Case study activity completion for the learners.

It is a **peer-driven endorsement system** where interns endorse each other’s learning and contributions. All endorsements together form a **connected endorsement network**.

For the network to remain valid:
Every chain of endorsements must **ultimately connect to a certified “Jedi”** (i.e., a **Silver, Bronze, or Gold ticket holder**).
Any group of interns not connected to a Jedi forms a **floating island**
Floating islands are considered **inactive**, and endorsements within them **will not be counted**.
and **every non-Jedi intern must receive one valid endorsement** to successfully complete the internship.
Jedis must act as **anchors** that validate and legitimize endorsement chains.
Each intern can **receive only one endorsement**
An intern may **endorse multiple other interns**
There is **no upper limit** on how many endorsements you can give  
You may endorse anyone **at your discretion**, after assessing them in any way you find appropriate.

However, a **tree with greater length rather than breadth** is encouraged to maintain strong, meaningful chains rather than shallow mass endorsements.

Recommended best practices:
- Interact with the intern before endorsing them
- Ensure they demonstrate **sufficient understanding of the MERN stack**, **ViBe course content**, and **case studies**
- Maintain a **healthy and collaborative interaction** — there is **no hierarchy or superiority** among co-interns, so please ensure that you interact with your co-interns in a friendly manner as peers

⚠️ **Important Warning:**  
Endorsing someone with **inadequate MERN fundamentals** may trigger **audit penalties** for the **entire tree or subtree** connected to that endorsement.

**You can  endorse or be endorsed by someone from your own college**

However:
Endorsements within the **same institute may raise suspicion**
Such connections have a **higher probability of being audited** by **Bhavna ma’am**
This is **not prohibited**, but interns are expected to endorse **responsibly and ethically**.

# audits:

Audits are conducted by **Bhavna**mam  to identify interns who need improvement and work on Case studies before they get into the project phase.

If a **Needs Improvement** intern is identified then 
The **entire endorsement path** connected to that intern is audited along with a**50% health point penalty** is applied to everyone in that connected group.The **intern and anyone who fails the audit** are **removed from the network**

If an intern is certified as **“good”** by Bhavna ma’am, They become **eligible to be endorsed by anyone**, even if they were previously disconnected.Their **credibility and trust score** within the network increases

# Incentives:
The network is intentionally designed to be **self-healing and incentive-driven**.

Whenever a new intern joins a **valid connected endorsement group**:
- Every existing member receives a **5% health point increase**
- The increase is calculated as:
  - **5% of their current health points**, plus  
  - **5% of the new member’s health points**

This encourages:
- Formation of **strong, connected networks**
- Avoidance of risky or isolated endorsement chains

# Endorsement Form:

All endorsements and de-endorsements must be submitted through the **official Google Form**
 The form should be filled **only once per endorsement**. The **endorser** should fill the form and must avoid duplicate or reciprocal entries.

The form contains **mandatory sections**:
1. **Endorser’s Name and Email**
2. **Endorsed Person’s Name and Email**
3. **Endorsement Status**
   - `Added` → for endorsement  
   - `Deleted` → for de-endorsement  
4. **Remarks**  
   - Write short, honest remarks based on your assessment
<!-- ⏳ **Deadline:**  
YET TO BE ANNOUNCED**. -->

# Tracking Endorsements:
Endorsements are tracked using a **three-column dataset**:

- **Member 1** → the endorser  
- **Member 2** → the endorsed intern  
- **Action** → endorsement or de-endorsement

Possible actions:
- **Add** → Member 1 endorsed Member 2  
- **Delete** → Member 1 de-endorsed Member 2  
- **Needs Improvement** → Member 1 is belongs to Needs Improvement category, Member 2 is the parent in the chain  

This dataset is used to:
Track endorsement paths,Detect floating islands and Conduct audits efficiently.

hence, Avoid careless, bulk, or reciprocal endorsements.Ensure your endorsement chain **connects to a Jedi**.Endorse based on **knowledge, effort, and contribution** and be mindful that poor endorsements can cause **audit cascades**

The Self-Healing Endorsement Network rewards **integrity, collaboration, responsibility, and accountability**.

## Health Points

Health Points (HP) are a scoring system used to track **individual and class participation and engagement throughout the internship**. Instead of focusing only on task completion, Health Points reflect how learners participate, collaborate, and follow defined communication and attendance norms. Positive participation leads to earning points, while actions that go against the system result in deductions. Over time, Health Points encourage accountability, consistency, and self-regulation.

They matter because,
Learning is not just about watching videos or submitting assignments. It also involves discipline, ownership, collaboration, and respect for shared processes. Health Points reinforce these values by recognising consistent effort and peer support, while discouraging disengagement or rule violations. This helps maintain a healthy and responsible learning environment.

Health Points are updated through an automated workflow supported by Google Forms. When you complete the **milestones on the ViBE platform** or the **milestones for Case Studies**, a defined **percentage (x%) of Health Points is automatically credited** to you. For other activities, Health Points are updated after the relevant **form is submitted**, and the updates are reflected on the dashboard with minimal delay. Additionally, a **VLED team member may submit the form** to award or deduct Health Points for specific learner contributions or misconduct.

Each learner starts with a **base (credit) Health Points value**, which is initially set to **100 HP**. All future additions and deductions are calculated as a **percentage of the learner’s current Health Points**, not as fixed values. Learners are **not allowed to remain at the base Health Points value for more than 5 days**. Each day a learner stays at the base Health Points level results in **one strike**. **Five consecutive strikes** will lead to **discontinuation from the internship**. Maintaining and improving Health Points through active participation is mandatory. If the **base Health Points value is updated** in the future (for example, from 100 to 150), learners who remain **below the new base Health Points value** and do not show progress will be **automatically discontinued from the internship**.


# Earning and Losing Individual Health Points:

Individual Health Points track a learner’s **daily participation and behaviour** during the internship.

You can earn individual Health Points by:
- Helping peers on the **Cliq channel**
- Completing the **milestones on the ViBE platform**
- Completing the **milestones for Case Studies**
- Completing the **assigned activities**

Individual Health Points are awarded **once per day**.

You lose individual Health Points for:
- Not having your **camera on during Zoom sessions**
- Asking queries **outside the designated Cliq channel**
- Replying to queries **outside the proper thread** in the Cliq channel
- Asking questions **during meetings** that are already addressed in the **FAQ or on the website**

These rules help ensure structured communication and active participation.

# class health points
Class Health Points are awarded to the **entire class** when the **number of students attending Zoom meetings meets the minimum required threshold**. These points promote collective responsibility and consistent attendance in live sessions.

### Writing a Blog as Part of Your Pinternship Journey with VLED Lab

<small>*(Activity: Call for Blogs)*</small>

<img src="../Blog_image.jpg" alt="Blog Writing" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;">

As part of your internship with the **VLED Lab**, we are opening a **Call for Blogs**—an invitation for you to pause, reflect, and put your journey into words. This activity is not about technical writing skills or perfect grammar. It is about **capturing your experience honestly**, in your own voice, as you lived through this internship.

### The Journey

This internship has been intentionally designed as a learning journey rather than a checklist. You began with a fully hands-on **MERN stack course delivered through ViBe**, where learning happened through practice and persistence. You then moved into solving **case studies**, which required you to think, reason, and struggle like a developer. For those who complete the case studies, the journey extended further—into **real project work alongside our developers**, where learning became responsibility.
Along the way, many experiences quietly shaped you. Learning on ViBe, navigating case studies, consistently learning, discussing ideas in breakout rooms, preparing for the viva, receiving feedback, and working in teams—each of these meant something different to each of you. That difference is what makes your story worth telling.

To help you reflect, you may think about experiences such as learning through ViBe, working through the MERN course, solving case studies, doing coding, understanding the role of consistency, or contributing to real projects. These are only prompts to help you remember. Do not pick any of these as your blog topic directly. Writing on the “easiest” idea is not the goal. Writing from your heart is.

What we are **not looking for** is a summary of the internship or a step-by-step description of what happened.

What we **are looking for** is your lived experience—your doubts, your growth, your surprises, and your takeaways. Write about what stayed with you after the sessions ended. Write about moments that changed how you think or learn. Write as if you are speaking to someone who has never experienced learning in this way.

### Publication

Your blog should first appear on your LinkedIn profile under the article section. You should tag VLED lab and it's members in your article. If we found the article interesting, inspiring and aligning with the Pinternship. We will select your submitted blog and it will be **reviewed by the VLED Lab team**. You will receive **comments and suggestions to help you improve your writing and clarity**. This is part of the learning process—we see writing as something that evolves through feedback, just like code.

After review the selected blogs will be **published on the Pinternship website under the Blogs section**. Additionally, **selected blogs will be recognised for their** thoughtful reflection, originality, and authenticity.

### Submission Instructions

You are first required to publish your blog on your LinkedIn under the [Article](https://www.linkedin.com/article/new/){:target="_blank"} section and then you are required to submit your blog as **Markdown file** to **Pinternship** GitHub repository as a new pull request. Your blog will be rendered as a webpage, so ensure it is readable, well-structured, and personal. Follow the folder structure, naming conventions, and file structure provided below.

### Creating a Vlog as Part of Your Pinternship Journey with VLED Lab

<small>*(Activity: Call for Vlogs)*</small>

<img src="../Vlog_image.png" alt="Vlog Creating" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;">

As part of your internship with the **VLED Lab**, we are opening a **Call for Vlogs**—an invitation for you to share your learning journey, technical skills, and project demonstrations through video. This activity is not about having professional equipment or perfect editing. It is about **showing your authentic experience**, sharing what you've learned, and helping others through visual storytelling.

### The Journey

Video is one of the most powerful ways to teach and motivate. When you show your screen while explaining code, walk through your debugging process, or demonstrate a feature you built—you create something that written words alone cannot capture. Your thought process, your real-time problem-solving, and your authentic voice make learning process easy and impactful.

What we are **not looking for** is highly polished, scripted content that feels impersonal.

What we **are looking for** is authentic and your honest experience of what worked and what didn't. Create content that you wish had existed when you were learning.

### Publication

Your vlog should first be uploaded to **your personal YouTube channel**. You should tag or mention **Vicharnashala** channel in your video description. If we find the video high-quality, informative, and aligned with Pinternship, we will select your submitted vlog and it will be **reviewed by the VLED Lab team**.

After review, the selected vlogs will be **embedded on the Pinternship website under the Vlogs section**. Additionally, **featured vlog creators will be recognised** for their contribution to the learning community.

### Submission Instructions

You are first required to upload your video to **your personal [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/){:target="_blank"} channel** and then you are required to submit your vlog as a **Markdown file with embedded video** to the **Pinternship** GitHub repository as a new pull request. Your vlog page will be rendered as a webpage, so ensure the markdown file is well-structured and includes proper video embedding. Follow the folder structure, naming conventions, and file structure provided below.

***Repository:*** [https://github.com/sudarshansudarshan/pinternship](https://github.com/sudarshansudarshan/pinternship){:target="_blank"}

***Folder Structure:*** Place your vlog file in the `_vlogs/` folder.

***Naming Convention***
Your file must be named: `Name_V_PinternshipID.md`, *Example:* `Mohit_V_12345.md`

***File Structure:***
Your vlog file must include front matter at the beginning with the following fields:
```markdown
---
title: "Your Video Title Here"
author: Your Full Name
pinternship_id: YOUR_PINTERNSHIP_ID
youtube_url: "URL"
---

Brief description of what your video covers and what viewers will learn along with the video embedded.
```

*This activity is not about perfection. It is about **sharing**.*

*Not about having the best equipment. But about **motivating others to learn**.*

*We look forward to featuring your content.*

## Protocols and Policies

<style>
  .page-content {
    text-align: justify;
  }
</style>


## Support and Resolution Protocol

The Pinternship programme follows a structured support and grievance redressal mechanism to ensure clarity, accountability, and timely resolution of participant queries. All students are required to follow the prescribed support flow in sequence before escalating any issue.

<img src="../support-escalation.png" alt="Escalation Protocol" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;">

### Broadcast Channel

The **Broadcast Channel** is the official communication channel of the Pinternship programme. All programme-related announcements, instructions, timelines, and policy updates shall be communicated exclusively through this channel.

This channel operates on a one-way communication model, and participants are not permitted to post responses or raise queries. Students are expected to regularly monitor this channel and act in accordance with the information communicated.

### Discussion Channel

The **Discussion Channel** is intended to facilitate student-student interaction and peer-supported problem solving. Participants may use this channel to seek clarifications, discuss academic or platform-related issues, and exchange ideas with fellow interns.

Students are expected to engage responsibly, maintain academic decorum, and review existing discussions before raising new queries.

### Support Desk

The **Pinternship Support Desk** constitutes the formal support mechanism for all technical, administrative, and programme-related issues. Participants are required to raise a support ticket through the official support desk at  
**pinternship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in** when their issue cannot be resolved through official announcements or peer discussion.

Students must retain their ticket reference number and allow adequate time for resolution before proceeding further.

### Escalation Channel

The **Escalation Channel** is a restricted support mechanism and shall be used strictly as a last resort. Participants may access this channel only when their query remains unresolved despite following all prior steps, including raising a formal support ticket with the Support Desk.

This channel is reserved for critical issues that materially affect participation or progression. Premature or inappropriate use of the escalation mechanism may result in delayed response.


### Usage of Emojis

1. Use 👍 to acknowledge a message as soon as it is posted.  
2. Use ✅ once the query has been resolved.  
3. Use 🔔 for FYI or informational updates.  
4. Use ➕ if you are facing a similar issue.  
5. Please reply within threads to keep the channel organized.

## Ejection Policy

### A Culture of Momentum: The Ejection Policy

<img src="../Ejection.png" alt="Ejection Policy" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;">

To maintain a high-energy environment, the program prioritizes **sustained effort** and active engagement over passive participation. We believe a learning community thrives when every participant contributes to the collective "pulse," which is why we employ a dynamic **Ejection Policy** to ensure the cohort remains focused. This system recognizes two distinct paths of movement:

#### Forward Eject (The Ascent)
Super-performers who consistently stay at the top of the cohort and demonstrate **exceptional performance** are "ejected" upward into advanced leadership opportunities. These individuals may also be considered for prestigious **fellowship nominations** based on their demonstrated capability and reflective practice.

#### Backward Eject (The Departure)
To preserve the quality of the experience and focus resources on committed learners, participants who remain persistently idle are removed from the cohort. This ensures that collaborative activities, such as **peer-to-peer viva sessions**, are conducted among interns who are equally invested in their growth.

### The Progress Algorithm

We ensure transparency and fairness by using an automated, dual-criteria filter to identify idle participants. A **Backward Eject** is only triggered if an intern meets **both** of the following conditions simultaneously:

1. **Daily Progress:** Your completion rate on the ViBe platform falls below **3.33% per day**.

2. **Cohort Standing:** Your overall engagement level ranks within the **bottom 10% of the active cohort**.

By maintaining a pace above this threshold, you ensure your spot in the program remains secure while you build meaningful professional artifacts, including **case studies and reflective blogs**.
